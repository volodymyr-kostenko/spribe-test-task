# Spribe test task

## Description

This is a test task for Spribe company.

## Caveats an considerations

- There TODOs in the code, which explain my assumptions.
- In the real project I would use testcontainers or an in-memory database for testing. Currently, one database for both runtime and tests is used.
- Swagger api description is available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.
- The free api version of fixer.io does not allow me to execute basic functionality. So the app is more my assumptions of how it works. 
- I couldn't clarify open requirements questions with the recruiter, so I made some assumptions regarding basic functionality.
